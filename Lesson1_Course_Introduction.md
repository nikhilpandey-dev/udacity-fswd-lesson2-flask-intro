## Prerequisites and Tech Stack
### Having the right expectations
- Being a good software engineer is about being a good beginner -- all, the, time. It doesn't matter if you've been in software for 1 month, 1 year, or 10 years. The field is constantly changing, every concept contains a rabbit hole of many more concepts to follow, and **the point is not to learn "everything" -- it is about scoping clearly what you want to build next. And then, having the foundations and learning strategies for knowing what you'll need to learn to build that next feature, or fix that next bug.**
> The great oxymoron of mastering software is being aware of what you haven't mastered, but knowing how to learn them with time, for the rest of your career.
